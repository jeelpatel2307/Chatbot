# Chatbot

Welcome to the Chatbot project! This simple Python project creates a basic chatbot using the `nltk` library for natural language processing.

## How to Run

1. **Download NLTK Data:**
   - Before running the chatbot, make sure to download the required NLTK data by using the command:
     ```bash
     pip install nltk
     python -m nltk.downloader punkt
     ```

2. **Run the Chatbot:**

     ```bash
     python chatbot.py
     ```

3. **Chat with the Chatbot:**
   - Start chatting with the chatbot! Type your messages, and the chatbot will respond based on predefined patterns.

4. **Exit the Chat:**
   - To exit the chat, type "exit."

## Project Structure
